# 3DEngine_2

This is not an attempt to create the worlds best 3D-engine. Rather it's been an exersise for me to understand the basic principles of 3D rendering and create something from nothing.

An attempt to improve upon my last 3D-enging with tighter code and more efficient projection.

Improvements upon my last 3D engine consists of, among other things, joint calculations of transformations of objects and the usage of projection instead of ray casting as rendering method.

This represents the stage at which the development of the engine rests at the moment:
